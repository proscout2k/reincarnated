To use this feature, you must both provide the launcher with additional files/info
It will work in conjunction with the Terror Zone system to provide real-time special events
EventSchedule.txt - This file will contain the start/end times of the event, as well as the folder name to use
EventName Folder - This folder will contain the modded event files and the preview image to use for it
Event.png - This file should be place inside the individual event folder to be used as a preview for the player
hd/global/local Folders - Include your modded files in the normal mod-folder structure to use for the event
desecratedzones.json - This file is the main method which you can easily control more gameplay or event-related features:
- Event Name
- Event Type
- Event Location(s)
- Event Description 1-4
- Event Link
- Event Start/End Time
- Event Message Announcement Times
- Enabled Difficulties
- Effected Map Levels
- Min/Max Monster Level
- Boosted Monster Level (+X from Player Level)
- Player Difficulty (Can be higher than 8)
- Experience Gain % (Can be negative)

This file must always be placed in the event's hd/global/excel folder; it was left out so you'd see it
Event-Related text, names, links, etc are displayed in the D2RLaunch window for the event
Due to the live-editing from the app, and the event-based system of TZ; you can create some fairly unique events
An example "EventSchedule" has been included, where this Event System managed a 48-hour mega-event, filled with 24 mini-events
I have also left the text used for one of the events, just to give a realistic example of it
