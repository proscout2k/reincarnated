-- Filter Options --
There are a few ways you can control or assist your playerbase with loot filter controls
Some example files and explanations are provided below and in the file examples
Players will pull from this folder when viewing the Loot Filter Menu with your mod selected

- lootfilter_default.lua
If you have a 'basic/standard' loot filter that you'd like to provide to your players, you can edit this file
This will show up as w/e you named the Title info in the players dropdown box

- override_rules.lua
D2RLAN also supports 'overrides', which allow your mod to specify rules that you'd like always used
Other filter authors can simply add 'Overrides = true" to allow your filter rules to be applied on their filter
This is useful if you need certain rules/formatting for the desired experience, while still allowing filter author freedoms

- GrailFilterBase.lua / GrailFilterAdv.lua
These are retail-based filters created by the Discord user 'MadMike'
They can be used as a practical example and a starter template for more retail-based mods

-- Final Notes -- 
Please be mindful of the development status of D2RLAN (and D2RHUD), which are still growing with our capabilities.
I do my best to minimize any 'hassle', while giving you as much control, support and flexibility as I can.
If you have any questions or concerns, reach out to me in Discord, and I will do my best to address them.
